She started a family with her college sweetheart Martin Ginsburg and enrolled in Harvard Law School where she was one of only nine women in her class.</p><p> She became one of the first woman elected to the Harvard Law Review, a feat she repeated at Columbia Law School, where she transferred for her final year.</p>

We sent out identical promotional letters–one signed with his name, and one signed Geraldine Weiss. He got all the responses, and I didn’t get a single one.</p> <p>When he left to work for a brokerage house, I was left with the business, and I realized that “Geraldine Weiss” was not going to attract any subscribers. So I started using G. Weiss. For years I received letters addressed to Mr. Weiss because nobody realized this service was being run by a woman. That is, until I was invited onto Louis Rukeyser’s show Wall Street Week in the mid-1970s. By then I’d been in business long enough that people were making money with my service.</p>

                            <p>In 1922, a time of both gender and racial discrimination, Coleman broke barriers and became the world's first black woman to earn a pilot's license.</p><p>Because flying schools in the United States denied her entry, she took it upon herself to learn French and move to France to achieve her goal. After only seven months, Coleman earned her license from France's well known Caudron Brother's School of Aviation.</p><p>Though she wanted to start a flying school for African Americans when she returned to the U.S., Coleman specialized in stunt flying and parachuting, and earned a living barnstorming and performing aerial tricks. In 1922, hers was the first public flight by an African- American woman in America.</p>

After 24 hours of hacking, 18 teams pitched their ideas. Honorable mentions went to Wonder Girls, an online network for women in tech to find partners to do passion projects together; WomanCard, digital cards that showcase current and past women leaders and pioneers in technology; and “Slack Bias Whaaat?!” a Slack bot that alerts users when they use biased language in their Slack conversations as they occur. </p>
